# ITE4065(Concurrent Programming)

This repo is to mirror the original hconnect gitlab repository.

## Projects

### 1. Project 1 \- Parallel Join Processing

This project is improving the performance of sequential join processing code which is given. Introducing parallel/concurrent execution models I've learned during the class, I was able to enhance the execution time from 75 secs to 15 secs.

### 2. Project 2 - Wait-free Atomic Snapshot

This project is implementing a wait-free atomic snapshot suggested in the textbook(The art of multiprocessor programming).

### 3. Project 3 - Improve the Bw-Tree

This project is to analyze the open Bw-tree and improve it **by yourself**, which means you need to tackle which factors are problematic and to prove whether it is problematic in fact.

### 4. Project 4 - Border-collie on PostgreSQL

This project is to implement the wait-free logging-boundary-finding algorithm in PostgreSQL.

Although I didn't remove the previously existing locks, just applying the approach of Border-Collie is just enough to enhance the overall performance.
